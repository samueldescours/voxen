# Voxen
Voxen is ment to become a fully functionnal high performance voxel engine (3D rendering + collisions calculations).

# Build
To build Voxen clone the repo then use make on the root.

# Dependencies
glfw3.h and glew must be aviable systemwide when compiling, if you prefer having a subdirectroy, you can make one called lib with the dependencies in it, the Makefile should use it (if it doesn't hit me with an issue).

# Liscence
This engine is under GNU GPL2.0 liscence.

# Contributing
If you want to contribute, don't hesitate to open an issue, if I validate the idea you can PR. Thanks for respecting these guidelines and for your help.
